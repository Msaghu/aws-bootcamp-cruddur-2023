# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching
Hi guys! Welcome back to week 5!! It getting hotter in the kitchen but lets learn about a few definitions today.
This week will be learning about NoSQl Databases and the different types that exist.
- Then we will learn about NoSQL database in AWS which is DynamoDB. So lets start!!

 
## Introduction
**What is NoSQL**
- A flexible document management system for key-value,document, tabular and graphs.
- Non-relational, distributed and scalable. and partition tolerant and 

**Why use NoSQL?**
- Application Development Productivity.
- Large scale data

**What are the characteristics of NoSQL databases?**
- Non-relational
- Distributed system that can manage large scale data while maintaining high throughput and availability.
- Scalable

**What are the differences between Non-Relational vs Relational Databases?**
| ---Non-Relational Databases---  | ---Relational Databases |
- NOT ONLY tables with fixed columns and rows vs Tables with fixed columns and rows
- Flexible schema vs Fixed Schema
- Scales out(horizontally scaling) vs Scales up(vertical scaling)

**What are the types of NoSQL database types?**
- key-value,
- document, 
- tabular and 
- graphs
- Multi-model type



## Prerequisites



## Use Cases
1. Will be used with our application for message caching
2. 

## Tasks



**Step 1 - gf**
A flat table as we do not hva ejoins as is the case with Relational databases.

**Step 2 - fffgg**
NoSQL workbench
DynamoDB Data Modelling

It is better to put similar items in the same table/ reduces complexity in the application
Globale tables?
Sort keys?
Access Patterns?
What are base tables?
What is a GSI?-Global Secondary Index
What are LSI? Local Secondary Indexes
GSI vs LSI?
