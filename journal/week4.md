# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

## Introduction

Whry AWS RDS Postgres over AWS Aurora?
## Prerequisites
1. AWS Free Tier account
2. AWS CLI on your local environment
3. Knowledge of SQL and PostgreSQL.
4. 

## Use Cases

## Tasks

**Step 1 - Spin up an PostgreSQL RDS(Relational Database System) via the AWS GUI**
- We will first have to spin up an RDS instance on AWS then stop it.
1. Search for RDS and choose **Create database**
2. On **Engine options**, choose Postgres
3. Choose the **Free tier** check box
4. Choose the **Instance configuration**
5. For **Storage**, leave the default option.
6. For **Connectivity** and **Network type** leave the default options.
7. For **Public Access** , allow public access
8. Use the **Default VPC** security group.
9. For **Database port**, leave it as the default 5432
10. For **Database authentication**, aloow for password authentication.
11. As for Monitoring, so that we can see 
12. We will turn off Backup, which is whnen AWS takes a snapshot of th DB for backup whuich reduces costs 
13. Enable **Encryption**
14. Do not enable **Log exports**
15. Do not **Enable Deletion protection**, which for production should be turned on for backup purposes.

**Step 2 - Use the AWS CLI in Gitpod to create/provision an RDS instance**
- Use the following command to create an RDS instance via the CLI, notice that the commands follow the set up in Step 1.
```
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier cruddur-db-instance \
  --db-instance-class db.t3.micro \
  --engine postgres \
  --engine-version  14.6 \
  --master-username cruddurroot \
  --master-user-password milkyway2023 \
  --allocated-storage 20 \
  --availability-zone us-east-1a \
  --backup-retention-period 0 \
  --port 5432 \
  --no-multi-az \
  --db-name cruddur \
  --storage-type gp2 \
  --publicly-accessible \
  --storage-encrypted \
  --enable-performance-insights \
  --performance-insights-retention-period 7 \
  --no-deletion-protection
```

- Switch over to the AWS Console and view the creation process of the database instance. 
- When the database instance has been fully created, the status will read created.
- Click into the Database instance and in the Actions tab Stop temporarily, it is stopped for 7 days (be sure to check on it after 7 days).
 
**Step 3 - Create a Database inside the AWS Database Instance**
- Start up Docker compose, then open the Docker extension and make sure that Postgres has started up,( we added Postgres into the Docker-compose file in the earlier weeks).
- Open the Postgres bash then, to be able to run psql commands inside the database instance we created above, run the following commands:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y postgresql-client-12
psql -Upostgres --host localhost
(When it prompts for password enter: ***password***
```

- Then to list existing databases run ```\l```
- To create a new database called cruddur we will run
``` CREATE database cruddur; ```

- As opposed to how we created the Database schema manually in our Dev.to tutorial , link below, here we will import it/ use a premade
- Since our Database will be used to store information, it will be useful in the backend.
- We will therefore create a new folder called **db** in the backend-flask folder, then we will create a file in the folder called **schema.sql**
-Paste the following into the schema.sql 
```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
```
***LONG METHOD (where we do not have to input the password each time)***
- To create the extension located in the schema.sql file, change(cd) into backend-flask then run the following command(if prompted for password enter password):
```
cd backend-flask/
psql cruddur < db/schema.sql -h localhost -U postgres
```

***SHORT METHOD (where we do not have to input the password each time)***
- To be able to get into our cruddur database(the short method). Run the following in the terminal(This will show that it works):
```
psql postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/cruddur 
OR
psql postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5432/cruddur
```

- In the terminal, paste the follwoing in the terminal(we should still be in backend-flask):
```
export CONNECTION_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5432/cruddur"
psql $CONNECTION_URL
```


**Step 4 - Bash Scripting**
- We will create 3 new files in backend-flask folder so that we can run bash scripts that enable us to quickly manage our databases.
- In the terminal run 
``` whereis bash```
- Copy the path into all the three files above. Remember to create a shabang(#!) at the beginning of the files that will indicate that they are bash files. The files will look like:
``` #! /usr/bin/bash ```

- To enable us to run the files as scripts, we need to be able to change their permissions so that they are executable, we can do this by running the following command on all the 3 files:
```
chmod u+x bin/db-create
chmod u+x bin/db-drop
chmod u+x bin/db-schema-load 
```

- We can test that the db-drop script is working by running:
``` ./bin/db-drop ```

- As we can see the command above will give an error, because we are still in the cruddur database(remember the command we ran above?):
```
echo $CONNECTION_URL   (output)======>postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5432/cruddur
```

- Therefore, if we want to get into psql with the command without going into our cruddur databse, we will paste the following into our db-drop script:
```
#! /usr/bin/bash

echo "db-drop"

NO_DB_CONNECTION_URL=$(sed 's/\/cruddur//g' <<< "$CONNECTION_URL")
psql $NO_DB_CONNECTION_URL -c "DROP DATABASE cruddur;"
```

- Then we can execute/run the sript by pasting into the terminal, to delete the cruddur database:
```
./bin/db-drop
```

- To use a script to create a cruddur database(again), paste the follwong in the db-create file:
```
#! /usr/bin/bash

echo "db-create"

NO_DB_CONNECTION_URL=$(sed 's/\/cruddur//g' <<< "$CONNECTION_URL")
psql $NO_DB_CONNECTION_URL -c "CREATE DATABASE cruddur;"
```

- Run ```./bin/db-create```

- To load the schema, paste the following in db-schema-load
```
#! /usr/bin/bash

echo "db-schema-load"

psql $CONNECTION_URL cruddur < db/schema.sql
```

- Run ```./bin/db-schema-load``
