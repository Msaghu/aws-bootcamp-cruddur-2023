# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

## Introduction

Whry AWS RDS Postgres over AWS Aurora?
## Prerequisites
1. AWS Free Tier account
2. AWS CLI on your local environment
3. Knowledge of SQL and PostgreSQL.
4. 

## Use Cases

## Tasks

#### Step 1 - Spin up an PostgreSQL RDS(Relational Database System) via the AWS GUI
- We will first have to spin up an RDS instance on AWS then stop it.
1. Search for RDS and choose **Create database**
2. On **Engine options**, choose Postgres
3. Choose the **Free tier** check box
4. Choose the **Instance configuration**
5. For **Storage**, leave the default option.
6. For **Connectivity** and **Network type** leave the default options.
7. For **Public Access** , allow public access
8. Use the **Default VPC** security group.
9. For **Database port**, leave it as the default 5432
10. For **Database authentication**, aloow for password authentication.
11. As for Monitoring, so that we can see 
12. We will turn off Backup, which is whnen AWS takes a snapshot of th DB for backup whuich reduces costs 
13. Enable **Encryption**
14. Do not enable **Log exports**
15. Do not **Enable Deletion protection**, which for production should be turned on for backup purposes.

#### Step 2 - Use the AWS CLI in Gitpod to create a RDS instance and create a Cruddur databse in the instance**
- Use the following command to create an RDS instance via the CLI, notice that the commands follow the set up in Step 1.
```
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier cruddur-db-instance \
  --db-instance-class db.t3.micro \
  --engine postgres \
  --engine-version  14.6 \
  --master-username cruddurroot \
  --master-user-password milkyway2023 \
  --allocated-storage 20 \
  --availability-zone us-east-1a \
  --backup-retention-period 0 \
  --port 5432 \
  --no-multi-az \
  --db-name cruddur \
  --storage-type gp2 \
  --publicly-accessible \
  --storage-encrypted \
  --enable-performance-insights \
  --performance-insights-retention-period 7 \
  --no-deletion-protection
```

- Switch over to the AWS Console and view the creation process of the database instance. 
- When the database instance has been fully created, the status will read created.
- Click into the Database instance and in the Actions tab Stop temporarily, it is stopped for 7 days (be sure to check on it after 7 days).
 
#### Step 3 - Create a local Cruddur Database in PostgreSQL
- Start up Docker compose, then open the Docker extension and make sure that Postgres has started up,( we added Postgres into the Docker-compose file in the earlier weeks).
- Open the Postgres bash then, to be able to run psql commands inside the database instance we created above, run the following commands:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y postgresql-client-12
psql -Upostgres --host localhost
(When it prompts for password enter: ***password***
```

- Then to list existing databases run ```\l```
- To create a new database called cruddur we will run
``` CREATE database cruddur; ```

- As opposed to how we created the Database schema manually in our Dev.to tutorial , link below, here we will import it/ use a premade
- Since our Database will be used to store information, it will be useful in the backend.
- We will therefore create a new folder called **db** in the backend-flask folder, then we will create a file in the folder called **schema.sql**
-Paste the following into the schema.sql 
```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
```
***LONG METHOD (where we do not have to input the password each time)***
- To create the extension located in the schema.sql file, change(cd) into backend-flask then run the following command(if prompted for password enter password):
```
cd backend-flask/
psql cruddur < db/schema.sql -h localhost -U postgres   =====> this will create an extension from schema.sql
```

***SHORT METHOD (where we do not have to input the password each time)***
- To be able to get into our cruddur database(the short method). Run the following in the terminal(This will show that it works):
```
psql postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/cruddur 
OR
psql postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5432/cruddur
```

- In the terminal, paste the follwoing in the terminal(we should still be in backend-flask):
```
export CONNECTION_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5432/cruddur"
psql $CONNECTION_URL
```

#### Step 4 - Bash Scripting
- We will create 3 new files in backend-flask folder so that we can run bash scripts that enable us to quickly manage our databases; db-create, db-seed, db-drop, db-schema-load
- In the terminal run 
``` whereis bash```

- Copy the path into all the three files above. Remember to create a shabang(#!) at the beginning of all the files that will indicate that they are bash files. The files will look like:
``` #! /usr/bin/bash ```

- To enable us to run the files as scripts, we need to be able to change their permissions so that they are executable, we can do this by running the following command on all the 3 files:
```
chmod u+x bin/db-create
chmod u+x bin/db-drop
chmod u+x bin/db-schema-load 
```

- We can test that the db-drop script is working by running:
``` ./bin/db-drop ```

- As we can see the command above will give an error, because we are still in the cruddur database(remember the command we ran above?):
```
echo $CONNECTION_URL   (output)======>postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5432/cruddur
```

- Therefore, if we want to get into psql with the command without going into our cruddur databse, we will paste the following into our db-drop script:
```
#! /usr/bin/bash

echo "db-drop"

NO_DB_CONNECTION_URL=$(sed 's/\/cruddur//g' <<< "$CONNECTION_URL")
psql $NO_DB_CONNECTION_URL -c "DROP DATABASE cruddur;"
```

- Then we can execute/run the sript by pasting into the terminal, to delete the cruddur database:
```
./bin/db-drop
```

- To use a script to create a cruddur database(again), paste the follwong in the db-create file:
```
#! /usr/bin/bash

echo "db-create"

NO_DB_CONNECTION_URL=$(sed 's/\/cruddur//g' <<< "$CONNECTION_URL")
psql $NO_DB_CONNECTION_URL -c "CREATE DATABASE cruddur;"
```

- Run ```./bin/db-create```

- To load the schema, paste the following in db-schema-load
```
#! /usr/bin/bash

echo "db-schema-load"

psql $CONNECTION_URL cruddur < db/schema.sql
```

- Run ```./bin/db-schema-load``

- Create a db-connect file and paste
```
#! /usr/bin/bash

psql $CONNECTION_URL 
```

- Change permissions ```chmod u+x ./bin/db-connect``` then run ```./bin/db-connect```

#### STEP 5 - Making the output nicer

- To make the bash script nicer, paste in db-schema-load
```
CYAN='\033[1;36m'
NO_COLOR='\033[0m'
LABEL="db-schema-load"
printf "${CYAN}== ${LABEL}${NO_COLOR}\n"
```

#### STEP 6 - Making the output nicer
- To create tables within our database, paste the code into the schema.sql file:
```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.users;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.activities;

CREATE TABLE public.users (
  uuid UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  display_name text,
  handle text,
  cognito_user_id text,
  created_at TIMESTAMP default current_timestamp NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE public.activities (
  uuid UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_uuid UUID NOT NULL,
  message text NOT NULL,
  replies_count integer DEFAULT 0,
  reposts_count integer DEFAULT 0,
  likes_count integer DEFAULT 0,
  reply_to_activity_uuid integer,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP default current_timestamp NOT NULL
);
```

- The drop table lines will make sure that if there are any existing tables in the database, they are deleted first before the new tables are created.

#### STEP 7 - Seeding/Adding data to the tables
- To add data, we will create a new file within db called seed.sql and add in the code below:
```
-- this file was manually created
INSERT INTO public.users (display_name, handle, cognito_user_id)
VALUES
  ('Andrew Brown', 'andrewbrown' ,'MOCK'),
  ('Andrew Bayko', 'bayko' ,'MOCK');

INSERT INTO public.activities (user_uuid, message, expires_at)
VALUES
  (
    (SELECT uuid from public.users WHERE users.handle = 'andrewbrown' LIMIT 1),
    'This was imported as seed data!',
    current_timestamp + interval '10 day'
  )
```

- Also create a file db-seed in our bash script files.
- Make sure to change permissions for the file in the terminal using:
```chmod u+x ./bin/db-seed```

- Then run ```./bin/db-seed``` in the terminal

#### STEP 8 - Connect to the database using the Databse explorer
- We will now need to connect to our database,(via the short method i.e calling the db-connect script);
- I the terminal, run ```./bin/db-connect```
- Once we are in the cruddur databse, run
```
\dt                                         =====> to view all tables
SELECT * FROM cruddur;                       =====> to show all culumns/fields in the cruddur DB
\ x on
\ x auto 
```

- Choose Database explorer from the left hand side of the console, click on the + tab , then 
choose database type as postgres
type in cruddur as the connection name
username should be postgres and port 5432
type in password as password
then enter cruddur as databases
then click connect

- If we attempt to drop the database using the script from the terminal, we will find that it 
the response will be that other connections are using it, as shown in the point above.

**To see active connections**
- To see other connections/sessions accesing our db, we will create a new script ```db-sessions```  and paste the code:
```
#! /usr/bin/bash

CYAN='\035[1;36m'
NO_COLOR='\035[0m'
LABEL="db-sessions"
printf "${CYAN}== ${LABEL}${NO_COLOR}\n"

if ["$1" = "prod" ]; then
    echo "using production"
    URL=$PROD_CONNECTION_URL
else
    URL=$CONNECTION_URL
fi

NO_DB_URL=$(sed 's/\/cruddur//g' <<<"$CONNECTION_URL")
psql $NO_DB_URL -c "select pid as process_id, \
       usename as user,  \
       datname as db, \
       client_addr, \
       application_name as app,\
       state \
from pg_stat_activity;"
```

- We will then execute it in the terminal to see the live connections.










**Errors encountered**
- When running ./bin/db-schema-load this was the error that I was encountering(i had begun video 2? the next day):
``` 
== db-schema-load
== db-schema-load
/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/backend-flask/db/schema.sql
./bin/db-schema-load: line 13: [: =: unary operator expected
psql: error: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
```
