# Week 6 â€” Deploying Containers with ECS and Fargate

What are Health checks?

# Perfoming Health checks on our Cruddur application
- To ensure the health of our Cruddur application, we would need to deploy health checks at various instances to ensure that it is running optimally.
- The various stages are:
1. At the Load Balancer level
2. At the container level
3. Of the RDS instance

{Before starting these stepos, make sure to start your RDS instance in AWS}

## Perform health checks on our RDS instance
- In ```backend-flask/db``` create a new file ```/test``` [backend-flask/db/test](_)
- This will tell us if health check was successful on our local postgres DB.
- Since we are now running in production, we will add production to the test script.
- This will connect us to our container.
-

## Perform health checks on our Flask App

# Prepare containers to be deployed to Fargate

## For Base image python
Create repository in ECR
```
aws ecr create-repository \
  --repository-name cruddur-python \
  --image-tag-mutability MUTABLE
  ```
 
 ## Log in to ECR 
 ```
 aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com"
 ```
 
 ## Set URL
 ```
 export ECR_PYTHON_URL="$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com/cruddur-python"
echo $ECR_PYTHON_URL
```

## Pull Python Image from Dockerhub
```
docker pull python:3.10-slim-buster
```

## Tag the Python image pulled above
```docker tag python:3.10-slim-buster $ECR_PYTHON_URL:3.10-slim-buster```

## Push the Python image to ECR
```docker push $ECR_PYTHON_URL:3.10-slim-buster```

## Prepare our Flask App to use the python image from ECR
Copy URI from ECR python

### Docker compose up
Run docker compose up for select services

## For Flask
Create Repo
```aws ecr create-repository \
  --repository-name backend-flask \
  --image-tag-mutability MUTABLE
```

Set URL
```
export ECR_BACKEND_FLASK_URL="$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com/backend-flask"
echo $ECR_BACKEND_FLASK_URL
```
 
 Build image
 ```
 docker build -t backend-flask .
 ```
 
 Tag Image
 ```
 docker tag backend-flask:latest $ECR_BACKEND_FLASK_URL:latest
 ```
 
 Push image
 ```
 docker push $ECR_BACKEND_FLASK_URL:latest
 ```

Register Task Definitions
- Create Parameter Store from Syetms manager to create parameters that will enable us to conceal sensitive information
- We will ensure that the items listed below have been set as environment variabels(i.r ruun env |  grep AWS_JHGGK<JK) to make sure that they have been set in your system.
- Then run the following commands in the terminal.
```
aws ssm put-parameter --type "SecureString" --name "/cruddur/backend-flask/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" --value $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws ssm put-parameter --type "SecureString" --name "/cruddur/backend-flask/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" --value $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
aws ssm put-parameter --type "SecureString" --name "/cruddur/backend-flask/CONNECTION_URL" --value $PROD_CONNECTION_URL
aws ssm put-parameter --type "SecureString" --name "/cruddur/backend-flask/ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN" --value $ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN
aws ssm put-parameter --type "SecureString" --name "/cruddur/backend-flask/OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS" --value "x-honeycomb-team=$HONEYCOMB_API_KEY"
```

- Check that the values have been set in ```AWS Systems Manger > Parameter Store``` to make sure that the values were correctly set.

Create an ECS role and attach a policy that will allow ECS to execute tasks
- In policies, create a service execution role, ```CruddurServiceExecutionRole``` [aws/policies/service-assume-role-execution-policy.json]() and run the following in the terminal to create the role:
```
aws iam create-role \    
--role-name CruddurServiceExecutionRole  \   
--assume-role-policy-document file://aws/policies/service-assume-role-execution-policy.json
```
- Confirm that the role was created in the AWS IAM console.
- We will now create a policy, ```CruddurServiceExecutionPolicy``` [aws/policies/service-execution-policy.json]() and attach it to the ```CruddurServiceExecutionRole``` and run the following in the terminal to create the policy and attch it to the role simultaneously:
```
aws iam put-role-policy \
  --policy-name CruddurServiceExecutionPolicy \
  --role-name CruddurServiceExecutionRole \
  --policy-document file://aws/policies/service-execution-policy.json
```



Create a task definition file(this defines how we provision an application)
Create it in the ECR console Tak definition 
Create a Task definition json file in , [aws/task-definitions/backend-flask.json]()
 

In the AWS ECR console
Choose clusters > Choose the ```cuddur``` cluster > Choose create > Choose Launch type ```FARGATE``` > Choose the platform version as ```LATEST``` > Choose the Deployment configuration ```Service``` >
