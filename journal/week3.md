# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

 
## Introduction
**What is Decentralized Authentication?**


**What is Amazon Cognito?**


**User pools vs User Identity pools in AWS Cognito?**


**What is the User Lifecycle Management?**


**What is Token Lifecycle Management?**


## Prerequisites
1. An AWS Account.
2. Github account
3. Gitpod account

## Use Cases
1. For the purpose of this application, we will be intergrating Amazon Cognito with our backend application with custom login pages.
2. AWS Cognito is a User Directory for Customer that can be used to access AWS resources.

## Tasks
- Provision via ClickOps a Amazon Cognito User Pool
- Implement API calls to Amazon Coginto for custom login, signup, recovery and forgot password page
- Show conditional elements and data based on logged in or logged out
- Verify JWT server side to serve authenticated API endpoints in Flask Application

### Decentralized Authentication in AWS Cloud
**Types of Authentication**
- OAuth
- OpenID Connect (used with OAuth)
- Username/Password
- SAML/ Single Sign on & Identity Provider
- Traditional Authentication

**Benefits of using AWS Cognito**
- Provides a User Directory for Customers.
- Provides ability to access AWS Resources for the Application being built.
- Identity Broker for AWS Resources with Temporary Credentials.
- Can extend users to AWS resources easily.

**Amazon Cognito Security Best Practises - for AWS**
- AWS Services - API Gateway, AWS Resources shared with the App Client(Backend or Back Channels).
- AWS WAF with Web ACLs for Rate Limiting, Allow/Deny List, Deny access from region & many more waf managementrules similar to OWASP.
- Amazon Cognito Compliance standard is what your business requires.
- Amazon Cognito should only be in the AWs region that you are legally allowed to be holding user data in.
- Amazon Organizations SCP - to manage User Pool deletion, creation, region lock etc
- AWS CloudTrail is enabled & monitored to trigger alerts on malicious Cognito behaviour by an identity in AWS.

**Amazon Cognito Security Best Practises - for the Application**
- Application should use an industry standard for Authentication & Authorization(SAML, OpenID Connect, OAuth2.0)
- App User Lifecycle Management - create, Modify, Delete users
- AWS User Access Lifecycle Management - Change of roles/ Revoke Roles
- Role based Access to manage how much access to AWS resources for the Application being built
- Token Lifecycle Management - Issue new tokens, revoke compromised tokens, where to store (client/server).
- Security tests of the application thropugh penetration testing.
- Access Token Scope - should be limited
- JWT(JSON Web Token) best practise - no sensitive info
- Encryption in Transit for API calls

### Install and configure Amplify client-side library for Amazon Congito
### Provision via ClickOps a Amazon Cognito User Pool
**Step 1 - Configure a User pool using AWS Cognito Cosnole**
- We will first use the AWS Console to configure a Userpool which is necessary to intergrate an application and we want to authenticate users.

### 
**Step 2 - implementing the Cognito Authentication in our frontend-js application**
- In the front-end-js folder, we will install the AWS Amplify libraries in the package.json file by pasting in and running the code in the terminal:
```
cd frontend-js
npm i aws-amplify --save
```

- To connect/hook-up our front-end application with AWS , we will open the ```app.js``` file in ```frontend-js/src/``` and paste in line 2:
```
cd frontend-js/src/app.js
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
```

- To configure amplify and connect our cognito pool to our frontend app.js, we will paste in the following in the ```app.js``` file.
```
Amplify.configure({
  "AWS_PROJECT_REGION": process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_PROJECT_REGION,
  "aws_cognito_region": process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_COGNITO_REGION,
  "aws_user_pools_id": process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID,
  "aws_user_pools_web_client_id": process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,
  "oauth": {},
  Auth: {
    // We are not using an Identity Pool
    // identityPoolId: process.env.REACT_APP_IDENTITY_POOL_ID, // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID
    region: process.env.REACT_AWS_PROJECT_REGION,           // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Region
    userPoolId: process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID,         // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito User Pool ID
    userPoolWebClientId: process.env.REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_WEB_CLIENT_ID,   // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito Web Client ID (26-char alphanumeric string)
  }
});
```

-In the Docker-compose file, in the frontend section of the code, we will add in the following:
```
   REACT_APP_AWS_PROJECT_REGION: "${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}"
   REACT_APP_AWS_COGNITO_REGION: "${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}"
   REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID: "us-east-1_randomrandom"
   REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID: ""    
```

***An error that I kept on encountering while trying to run the command below
``` aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password --user-pool-id us-east-1_vvv --username maureen --password Nxxxxxxxx --permanent```
An error occurred (InvalidParameterException) when calling the AdminSetUserPassword operation: 1 validation error detected: Value at 'password' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must satisfy regular expression pattern: ^[\S]+.*[\S]+$***
***I had to make sure to create a new user in the Cognito user pool and delete the previous one.***

### Show conditional elements and data based on logged in or logged out
**Step 3 - Home Page to show components only when logged in/out**
- In the frontend add the follwoing lines:
```
cd frontend-js/src/pages/HomeFeedPage.js
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
```

- We will replace the existing on-submit code-block with:
```
// check if we are authenicated
const checkAuth = async () => {
  Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser({
    // Optional, By default is false. 
    // If set to true, this call will send a 
    // request to Cognito to get the latest user data
    bypassCache: false 
  })
  .then((user) => {
    console.log('user',user);
    return Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser()
  }).then((cognito_user) => {
      setUser({
        display_name: cognito_user.attributes.name,
        handle: cognito_user.attributes.preferred_username
      })
  })
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
};
```

- In the ```ProfileInfo.js``` page, we will replace the Athentication with cookies page with the code in line 2below:
```
import Cookies from 'js-cookie';

with

import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';
```

- Since we will not be using cookies anymore, we will paste in the code below:
```
const signOut = async () => {
  try {
      await Auth.signOut({ global: true });
      window.location.href = "/"
  } catch (error) {
      console.log('error signing out: ', error);
  }
}
```

- Make sure that our up is running without errors by starting up the container using Docker-compose up.

**Setp 4 - Modifying the sign in page**
- Paste the following in the ```frontend-js/signup.js/```:
```
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';
```

- We will replace the existing on-submit code-block with:
```
  const onsubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    setErrors('')
    try {
      const { user } = await Auth.signUp({
        username: email,
        password: password,
        attributes: {
          name: name,
          email: email,
          preferred_username: username,
        },
        autoSignIn: { // optional - enables auto sign in after user is confirmed
            enabled: true,
        }
      });
      console.log(user);
      window.location.href = `/confirm?email=${email}`
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
        setErrors(error.message)
    }
    return false
  }
```
