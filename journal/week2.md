# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing
- Hey guys , welcome back to Week 2!
-For a beginner like me, I would like to present a few definitions before we get into the homework challenges and the stretch challenges too!
 
## Introduction
-

## Prerequisites
We will cover a few definitions here that are necessary for us to Understand Distributed Tracing and Logging.

For the purposes of this Class/week we need to have set up a few resources that will assist us and we will also learn about how to use them.

**What are Metrics?**
- Are measurements of specific data points aggregated over a period of time i.e CPU usage, memory and bandwidth.
- We can only collect metrics on what we know.

**What is Monitoring?***
- An action that we perform against our applications and systems to determine their state.
- It collects metrics and compares them against a defined state/value .
- Shows if they are ruunning or not, to also perfoming perfomance health checks.
- 

**What is Observability?**
- Being able to loodk at data from outside the system about what is going on within the system.
- ***Pattern Recognition*** - 

**What is Logging?**
- jjhh
- To be able to view logs correctly of multiple applications at the same time, we need to make sure that we properly aggreagate the logs.
- ***Log Levels*** - allow us to see classifcations of logs within a log.
Debug, Info, Warnings, Critical, Error

What are the issues with logging
1. When we have Debug on that provides all information, we get log fatigue which can make it very easy easy to miss critical warnings.
2. Logs take up alot of disk space.

**What is Tracing?**
- Information about individual transactions/requests i.e the time a request took, errors that occurred during the process.
- Helps us understand latency between applications.

**What can we observe?**
- Application Perfomance(types of application perfomance monitoring tools include **Datadog**, **Honeycomb**, **New Relic**)
- Infrastructure
- Networks
- Events
- Databases
- Logs and log analysis
